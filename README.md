Hi!
Here is my word on the Chrome Extension Project.
It wasn't perfect, but I did a great job.

Due to time constraints, It hasn't been finished yet. As the program was being tested, there were some errors, some of which I solved, and some of which I did not.

It was a challenging project to work on, but I defied time and this is the result.

Thank you for allowing me to have this experience with you.

The files needed for the project:
1.public\background.js
2.public\content.js
3.public\manifest.json
4.src\App.js
5.src\Home.js
6.src\Login.js
